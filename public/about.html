<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
  Hi, and thank you for the opportunity to interview today. My name is Mustafa 
  Magdi, and I am a final-year student at University Tun Hussien Onn Malaysia 
  <b>(UTHM).</b>, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on 
  Information Technology. I'm originally from Sudan and have always been 
  passionate about technology, particularly web development. I have skills in 
  <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b>, as well as a solid understanding of <b>C and C++.</b><br><br>


  In addition to my studies, I've been running a small electronics business for 
  the past year and a half, where I sell items such as headphones and earbuds. 
  Through this entrepreneurial venture, I’ve engaged with a wide range of 
  customers, advertising and promoting my products through platforms like 
  WhatsApp and Facebook. This experience not only enhanced my sales and 
  marketing skills but also taught me how to handle client interactions 
  effectively and solve real-time problems. It also helped me sharpen my digital 
  marketing skills, which I believe would be valuable for the position I’m 
  applying for. Moreover, this entrepreneurial experience has deepened my</p>

  <h2>Strength & Weaknesses</h2>
<p><b>My strengths</b> include being a fast learner and having a strong problem
  solving mindset. I have a solid foundation in  technologies, and I thrive 
  in situations that require me to think critically and develop creative 
  solutions. My experience running an electronics business has also helped 
  me develop strong communication skills, especially when it comes to 
  understanding and meeting customer needs.<br><br> 
  <b>As for weaknesses</b>, I sometimes find myself spending too much time on 
  the finer details of a project because I strive for perfection. For instance, 
  when developing a website or an online ad for my business, I would often 
  tweak small aspects to make sure everything looks perfect. However, I’m 
  working on balancing quality with efficiency by setting clearer deadlines 
  and focusing on the most important aspects first.  </p>
